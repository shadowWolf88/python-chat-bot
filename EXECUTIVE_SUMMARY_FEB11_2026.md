### What We Don't Have
- ❌ **Competitive clinician dashboard** (missing 20+ features vs. competitors)
- ❌ **Patient engagement features** (no gamification, badges, or progress celebration)
- ❌ **Complete clinical assessment suite** (C-SSRS in place, but PHQ-9/GAD-7 missing)
- ❌ **Developer tooling** (no monitoring dashboard, CI/CD pipeline)
- ❌ **High-impact quick wins** (12-16 hrs of work = 15-25% engagement lift)

### Bottom Line

## ⚠️ RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Scope Creep
**Risk**: Adding features beyond Phase 1 before Phase 1 is complete  
**Mitigation**: Strict sprint boundaries, weekly progress reviews, kill switch on new features

### Risk 2: Clinician Feedback Ignored
**Risk**: Build features clinicians don't want  
**Mitigation**: Weekly clinician advisory board, early & frequent testing, feedback loops

### Risk 3: Patient Engagement Gamification Backfires
**Risk**: Badges feel trivial, reduce credibility  
**Mitigation**: A/B test every feature, measure engagement lift, iterate quickly

### Risk 4: Developer Burnout
**Risk**: 230+ hours invested already, team is fatigued  
**Mitigation**: Rotate team members, celebrate wins, hire contractors for surge work

### Risk 5: Clinical Validation Delays
**Risk**: Features blocked waiting for clinical review  
**Mitigation**: Engage advisory board early, parallel streams (development + validation)
