## 🎯 YOUR IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (This Week)

### ✅ BY FEB 10 (Monday - 3 Days)
- [ ] Research Head of Psychology at Lincoln University (name, email, interests)
- [ ] Read through all 4 critical documents (verify they make sense to you)
- [ ] Draft personalized email to Lincoln using template from LINCOLN_APPROACH_CHECKLIST.md

### ✅ BY FEB 14 (Friday - 1 Week)
- [ ] **SEND** initial contact email to Head of Psychology
  - Attachments: 4 governance documents
  - Request: 20-30 min exploratory call
  - Dates: Suggest Feb 17-21

### ✅ BY FEB 28 (Ready to Code)
- [ ] Ethics approval submission initiated (if Lincoln interested)
- [ ] Begin C-SSRS database schema implementation
- [ ] Begin clinician alert system coding
- [ ] Weekly governance calls established

---

## 💡 WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS

**For You:**
✅ Proves concept with real users (university staff/students)  
✅ Validates C-SSRS algorithm in practice  
✅ Gets institutional credibility for NHS pitch (major value)  
✅ Fast timeline (8 weeks to MVP) vs. slower NHS route  
✅ Lower governance burden (university handles ethics, you do tech)  

**For Lincoln University:**
✅ No cost to them (you cover hosting, dev, maintenance)  
✅ Research opportunity (publication rights)  
✅ Innovation credential (early adopters)  
✅ Minimal time commitment (2 hrs/month from clinical advisor)  
✅ Helps their reputation (supporting innovation)  

**This is a win-win deal. Lincoln will likely be interested.**

---

## 🚀 YOUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

**Most digital health startups:**
- Skip governance documentation until forced
- Try to do NHS without university validation
- Take 18+ months to launch

**You:**
- ✅ Have complete governance docs written (week 1)
- ✅ Have clinical safety case signed (soon)
- ✅ Have real users testing in 8 weeks
- ✅ Will be NHS-ready in 12-16 weeks total
- ✅ Will have incident history (clean, hopefully) to prove safety

**Timeline advantage: 6+ months faster than typical approach**

---

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

**Feb 14 (Email sent):**
- [ ] Contact email delivered to Lincoln head
- [ ] Ready to discuss if they call back

**Feb 28 (2 weeks after contact):**
- [ ] Lincoln interested? Yes/No
- [ ] Ethics approval path clear? Yes/No
- [ ] C-SSRS code started? Yes/No

**Mar 31 (4 weeks, halfway point):**
- [ ] Ethics approval received or on track
- [ ] C-SSRS assessment API complete + tested
- [ ] Alert system functional
- [ ] Clinical dashboard MVP done

**Apr 30 (8 weeks, launch):**
- [ ] Full system live with real users
- [ ] All safety controls verified
- [ ] Zero critical incidents (hopefully)
- [ ] Ready for NHS pitch

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Risk Assumptions Built Into Documents

Your governance docs assume:
- ✅ C-SSRS algorithm is correct (you'll validate with clinical advisor)
- ✅ 10-minute response time for CRITICAL alerts is achievable (you'll adjust if needed)
- ✅ Clinicians will actually respond to alerts (documented as expectation)
- ✅ Encryption + RBAC working as designed (you'll test before launch)

### Clinical Advisor Sign-Off

When you find a clinical advisor:
1. Have them review CLINICAL_SAFETY_CASE.md - they'll sign the bottom
2. Have them review CRISIS_RESPONSE_PROTOCOL.md - they'll confirm timings are realistic
3. Have them review PATIENT_INFORMATION_LEAFLET.md - they'll ensure it's accurate
4. Have them review DATA_PROTECTION_IMPACT_ASSESSMENT.md - they'll work with university DPO

**This is easy work for them (2-3 hours per doc = maybe 8-10 hours total)**

### What If Lincoln Says No?

You have backup options:
- University of Manchester (similar approach)
- Sheffield University (strong mental health programs)
- UCL Psychology (London base)
- NHS Trusts might be interested directly (different timeline)

But Lincoln is excellent choice. Go for them first.
