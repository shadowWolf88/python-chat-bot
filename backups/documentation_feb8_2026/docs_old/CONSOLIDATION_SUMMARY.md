## 📋 NEXT STEPS (OPTIONAL)

### Recommended (Nice to have)
- [ ] Archive 13 deprecated docs to `documentation/archive_deprecated/`
- [ ] Update `README.md` to reference canonical docs
- [ ] Update `documentation/00_INDEX.md` to reference canonical docs
- [ ] Schedule 30-day documentation review

### Not required
- Old docs in archive can stay (for historical reference)
