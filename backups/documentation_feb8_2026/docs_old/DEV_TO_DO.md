## My To-Do list (rick)

in the wellness tracking, on the first question (how are you feeling today? ) the text entry is next to the buttom, and is tiny and not visible. 

find out how the risk monitor decides between critical/high/moderate and low patients?
is the risk assesment listening to conversations in the ai therapist chat bot section of the patients account?

ai clinician summary not working, charts tab not showing charts, profile has no data for patient, mood logs show nothing in clin dash, same for assesments, therapy, and alerts. also cant book appointments, also, cant write new mesage (and two message tabs, remove one, fix other. Fix layout for clinician dashboard.
