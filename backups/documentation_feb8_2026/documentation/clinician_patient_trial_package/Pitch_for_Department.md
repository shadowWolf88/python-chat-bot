Pitch: Healing Space — Pilot with Student Clinicians

Executive Summary
- Healing Space is a secure, supervised digital mental health platform that supports clinician-led check-ins, mood tracking, and safe data export for research and clinical teaching.
- We propose a small feasibility pilot with student clinicians and volunteer students to evaluate usability, training value, and safety procedures.

AI-first value proposition
- Healing Space is designed around an AI assistant that helps patients capture and reflect on what happens between sessions, and that synthesizes those interactions into clinically useful summaries for clinicians. The AI analyzes mood logs, short daily journals, in-dashboard chats, and session transcripts to detect trends, contextualize events, and highlight risks — helping bridge the gap between appointments.

Why this matters to the department
- Unique educational opportunity: supervised, hands-on experience for student clinicians using a production web platform with built-in safety monitoring and audit trails.
- Research value: collect feasibility, acceptability, and safety data to inform larger trials and curriculum integration.
- Low operational footprint: participants access via a hosted website — no local install or dev work required for students.

Why AI matters
- Continuity of care: many patients struggle to remember or summarise everything that happens between sessions. By providing a safe place to log experiences and chat with the assistant, Healing Space preserves context and an ongoing timeline that clinicians can review.
- Efficiency and insight: rather than manually reading dozens of short entries, clinicians receive AI-generated, evidence-aligned summaries and highlights that save time and improve case formulation.
- Learning tool: student clinicians can use the AI summaries to reflect on evolving patient patterns and focus supervision conversations on the most clinically relevant material.

Pilot overview (proposed)
- Design: single-arm feasibility pilot
- Duration: 4 weeks active per participant; 2-week onboarding and training
- Sample: ~10 student clinicians, ~30 volunteer students (patients)
- Key outcomes: recruitment/retention, session completion, clinician/patient usability, number and handling of safety alerts

Patient-centred rationale
- Real-world patient need: many users report that keeping track of symptoms, events and feelings between sessions is difficult, and that important context gets lost. Healing Space gives patients a private, clinician-supervised space to record and process these experiences. With permission, the AI aggregates and highlights the most relevant data for clinicians, improving continuity and treatment quality.

What students (clinicians) gain
- Practical exposure to remote/digital consultation workflows
- Experience with clinical documentation, FHIR export basics, and safety escalation
- Structured feedback to support reflective learning and assessment

AI-specific clinician gains
- Practice interpreting AI-generated summaries and using them in case formulation and supervision.
- Experience supervising AI-assisted care and learning when to rely on automated insights and when to apply clinical judgment.

What participants (patients) gain
- Easy web access to mood tracking and clinician-supported check-ins
- Supervised student clinician contact with safety oversight
- Opportunity to contribute to research improving student training and digital care

Logistics & support
- Access: hosted at your study URL (e.g., https://www.healing-space.org.uk); accounts provisioned by study admin
- Training: single 90-minute clinician onboarding session (demo + safety workshop)
- Supervision: senior clinician on-call for safety escalations and weekly review
- Data & ethics: PII encrypted and access-limited; anonymization pipeline for research exports. IRB approval required (we will supply protocol and consent templates).

Safety
- The platform includes automated SafetyMonitor alerts; all flagged events route to supervising staff and are recorded in `audit_logs`.
- Supervisors will receive training on triage, immediate escalation, and documentation.

Ethical and privacy safeguards for AI
- AI functions operate only on data the patient has chosen to share; all exports and clinician-visible summaries require consent. PII is stored and transmitted under encryption controlled by the study administrators. The AI is positioned as a decision-support and summarization tool — not a replacement for clinical judgment. We will document the AI's scope and limitations in training materials.

Timeline
- Weeks 0-2: IRB, recruitment, account provisioning, clinician training
- Weeks 3-6: Pilot run (sessions + mood logging)
- Weeks 7-8: Data cleaning, analysis, debrief

Resources requested from department
- Clinical supervisors (on-call and weekly review)
- Permission to recruit students (clinicians and participants) and use campus communications for recruitment
- IRB support and sign-off

Call to action
- If approved, we will schedule a 20-minute briefing with you and the teaching team to finalize details and begin recruitment.

Call to action
- If approved, we will schedule a 20-minute briefing with you and the teaching team to finalize details and begin recruitment. We can bring a short demo showing how the AI summarizes a patient's week of logs into a clinician-friendly report.
