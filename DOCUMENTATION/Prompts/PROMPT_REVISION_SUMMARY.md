# Community + Pet Integration Prompt: Revision Summary

## What Changed

The original Community prompt has been completely rebuilt to integrate the existing Pet Game system. This is **not additive**—it's a fundamental reconception of both systems as a unified ecosystem.

- Pet reflects your community engagement & mental health journey
- Community celebrates your pet's milestones
- Rewards (coins/XP) earned in BOTH systems, spent in BOTH systems
- Pet personality develops FROM user behavior (not randomized)
