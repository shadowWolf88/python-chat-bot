# HEALING SPACE UK — MASTER PRODUCT ROADMAP
## World-Class Mental Health Platform: The Definitive Plan
### Audit Date: February 22, 2026 | Full Platform Audit + Strategic Vision

---

> **Vision**: Healing Space UK becomes the most clinically rigorous, technologically advanced, and genuinely human mental health platform in the UK — the tool that clinicians choose because it makes them better at their jobs, that patients love because it meets them where they are, and that sets the standard for what digital mental health care should be.
>
> **The Healing Journey Principle**: Every person using this platform is the hero of their own story. Therapy isn't a clinical process — it's an epic, deeply personal journey from darkness toward light. Our platform should feel like a sacred companion: part guide, part celebration, part magic. Less clipboard, more compass.

## THE HEALING JOURNEY — GAMIFICATION & ENGAGEMENT VISION
### *"Less clipboard, more compass. Less clinic, more quest."*

This is the transformative layer that turns Healing Space UK from a clinical tool into something people genuinely love using — and that makes the clinical work go deeper.

**The Core Metaphor**: Every patient is the **Hero** of their own healing quest. Their therapist is the **Guide** — not a superior, but a wise companion who has walked this path before. The platform is the **Sanctuary** — a safe world they carry in their pocket. Progress through therapy isn't filling forms; it's **levelling up**, **earning powers**, **unlocking new chapters**.

This layer sits **on top** of the clinical engine — the outcomes, the PHQ-9 scores, the session notes all remain exactly as clinical as they need to be. The magic is how we *present* that journey to the patient.

---

### HJ.1 THE QUEST SYSTEM ✅ (Feb 22, 2026)
**Priority: HIGH — Core engagement mechanic**

Reframe therapeutic work as quests. Each quest corresponds to a real clinical intervention or homework task:

**Quest Types**:
- **Daily Rituals** — "The Morning Compass" (complete your wellness check-in), "The Evening Lantern" (log gratitude + mood)
- **Skill Quests** — "The Thought Challenger" (complete 3 CBT thought records this week), "The Breathing Stone" (practice box breathing 5 days running)
- **Exploration Quests** — "The Shadow Journal" (write about a difficult emotion), "The Gratitude Grove" (log 7 gratitude entries)
- **Courage Quests** — clinician-assigned behavioural experiments ("Face one avoided situation this week")
- **Connection Quests** — community participation, peer support interactions
- **Arc Quests** — multi-week journeys tied to the full CBT programme ("The 8-Week Clarity Path")

**Mechanics**:
- Quest has a title, description, what the patient will gain ("You'll develop the skill of…"), an expected effort indicator, and a reward
- Quests awarded by clinician or auto-suggested by platform based on patient's progress
- Progress bar within each quest
- Quest completion triggers milestone celebration

**Implemented**: `quest_definitions` (20 seeded quests), `patient_quests`, `quest_progress_log` tables. `_advance_quest_progress()` helper hooked into wellness/mood/gratitude/CBT endpoints. 6 API endpoints (GET quests, accept, abandon, clinician view/assign, spell cast, spell library). Frontend: Quest Board replaces daily tasks widget, Accept Quest modal, completion celebration overlay.

---

### HJ.2 THE SPELL LIBRARY (REFRAMED CBT TOOLS) ✅ (Feb 22, 2026)
**Priority: HIGH — Reframes the existing toolset**

The 17 CBT tools already exist. The change is purely in presentation — **spells are skills** you learn to cast when you need them:

| Clinical Tool | Spell Name | Description |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| Thought Record | **Clarity Spell** | Examine and reframe unhelpful thoughts |
| Breathing Exercise | **Calm Breath** | Regulate your nervous system instantly |
| Behavioural Activation | **Spark of Motion** | Break the depression cycle with action |
| Grounding (5-4-3-2-1) | **Anchor Ritual** | Return to the present moment |
| Problem Solving | **The Compass** | Navigate from stuck to moving |
| Values Clarification | **True North** | Connect to what matters most |
| Worry Time | **The Containment Vessel** | Contain anxiety to its proper time |
| Gratitude Journal | **Gratitude Seeds** | Plant moments of brightness |
| Self-compassion | **The Healing Salve** | Treat yourself with the care you'd give a friend |
| Progressive Muscle Relaxation | **The Stone Melting** | Release tension from the body |

**Implementation**:
- Each tool page gets a subtle "spell name" as a secondary header — the clinical name stays prominent
- Completing a tool for the first time "learns" the spell — small animation, added to Spell Library
- Spell Library page shows all mastered spells with usage count ("Cast 23 times")
- Spells have a "power level" that increases with usage frequency (visual indicator only)
**Implemented**: `spell_mastery` DB table (cast_count, power_level 1-5). `SPELL_MAP` constant with 15 spell names/elements/flavors/colours. Modified CBT tool grid shows spell name + colour stripe. `loadAndRecordSpell()` records mastery. Spell Library toggle view shows mastered spells with power orbs + cast count, unmastered as locked scrolls. First-cast "Spell Learned!" animation overlay. `POST /api/user/spell/cast` + `GET /api/user/spells` endpoints.

---

### HJ.3 THE SANCTUARY (HOME SCREEN REDESIGN) ✅ (Feb 22, 2026)
**Priority: MEDIUM — Major UX transformation**

The home screen evolves from a dashboard of widgets to a **living, personalised sanctuary**:

**Sanctuary Elements**:
- **The Hearth** — daily wellness ritual (currently wellness check-in) — warm, welcoming
- **The Quest Board** — current active quests, progress, what's next
- **The Mood Garden** — mood log visualised as a garden: high mood = blooming flowers, low mood = rain clouds (but beautiful rain, not depressing)
- **The Spell Circle** — 3 recommended spells for today based on current state
- **The Milestone Wall** — achievements displayed as glowing stones or illuminated scrolls
- **Your Companion** — the pet, but evolved into a spirit animal / familiar concept
- **The Weekly Ember** — weekly progress summary, flame grows with engagement

**Design Principles**:
- Warm, earthy palette option (alongside existing themes) — forest greens, amber, deep purples
- Gentle animations — nothing jarring, nothing clinical
- Seasonal changes — autumn colours, winter snow in the sanctuary background
- Deeply personal — patient's name woven in, their milestones visible

**Implemented**: Sanctuary CSS theme (`[data-theme="sanctuary"]`) with amber/forest/navy palette + custom CSS variables. Animations: sanctuaryFloat, emberFlicker, spellPulse. Home tab fully redesigned with 7 sections: Sanctuary Header, The Hearth (wellness ritual), Quest Board, Mood Garden (Canvas), Spell Circle (3 contextual spells), Milestone Wall, Companion (pet), Weekly Ember (streak flames). 🌿 theme toggle button in header.

---

### HJ.4 THE FAMILIAR (PET EVOLUTION SYSTEM)
**Priority: MEDIUM — Extends existing pet system**

The existing pet becomes a **healing familiar** — a spirit companion that grows as the patient heals:

**Evolution Path** (5 stages tied to clinical milestones):
1. **Seedling** — the familiar is just a glowing seed (registration → first week)
2. **Sprout** — a small, curious creature emerges (7-day streak, first PHQ-9)
3. **Companion** — the familiar is fully formed, animated, responsive (30-day streak, PHQ-9 improvement)
4. **Guide** — the familiar gains wisdom markings, helps suggest daily actions (60-day engagement, moderate → mild on PHQ-9)
5. **Elder** — majestic, fully evolved, becomes a visible symbol of the journey (significant clinical recovery)

**Familiar Types** (patient chooses at start or it morphs based on their style):
- The Fox (clever, curious — suits analytical/CBT patients)
- The Owl (wise, calm — suits reflective/mindfulness patients)
- The Wolf (brave, loyal — suits trauma-focused patients)
- The Deer (gentle, sensitive — suits anxiety patients)
- The Bear (strong, grounded — suits depression patients)

**Mechanics**:
- Familiar responds to mood: sad = nuzzles closer; happy = playful animations
- Feeding the familiar = completing daily wellness ritual
- Familiar sends "messages" = nudges in the familiar's voice ("I noticed you haven't cast a Clarity Spell in a while. Want to try one today?")

---

### HJ.5 THE ACHIEVEMENT CONSTELLATION
**Priority: MEDIUM — Extends existing achievement system**

50+ achievements across all platform areas, presented as stars forming constellations in a night sky:

**Constellation Groups**:
- **The Seeker's Path** — engagement milestones (7-day streak, 30-day streak, 100-day streak)
- **The Healer's Tools** — CBT tool mastery (first use, 10 uses, 50 uses of each spell)
- **The Courage Stones** — facing difficult things (first thought record, first safety check, first crisis survived)
- **The Gratitude Grove** — gratitude practice (10, 50, 100 entries)
- **The Chart of Progress** — clinical milestones (PHQ-9 drops from severe → moderate → mild → minimal)
- **The Connection Web** — community and peer engagement
- **The Ritual Keeper** — wellness ritual completion streaks
- **The Bright Days** — sustained wellbeing (7 consecutive mood ≥ 7 days)
- **The Night Survived** — especially meaningful: completing a crisis moment and continuing

**Presentation**:
- Night sky canvas with stars forming meaningful shapes
- Each constellation has a name and a one-line story ("The Seeker's Path: You chose to look within")
- Newly unlocked constellations animate beautifully on the screen
- Achievement notification: not a badge pop-up — a gentle glowing message from the familiar

---

### HJ.6 THE CLINICIAN AS GUIDE
**Priority: HIGH — Reframes the therapeutic relationship**

The clinician view doesn't change clinically — but the patient-facing language does:

**Clinician Identity in the Platform**:
- Patients see their clinician referred to as their **"Guide"** (configurable — clinician can change to their preference)
- Guide can send **Milestone Scrolls** — personal messages when they notice a breakthrough (already built in 1.7 — expand the design)
- Guide can assign **Quest Packs** — themed sets of homework/tools for a specific therapeutic goal
- Guide can send **Daily Encouragements** — short messages that arrive in the sanctuary like notes left by a guide
- Guide's weekly summary note (if written) appears in the patient's sanctuary as a **"Letter from Your Guide"**
- The treatment plan, when visible to the patient, is presented as **"Your Map"** — where you're going and how you'll get there

---

### HJ.7 RECOVERY VISUALIZATION — THE JOURNEY MAP
**Priority: HIGH — Patients need to *see* their journey**

A visual timeline of the entire therapeutic journey — from the first day to today:

**The Journey Map shows**:
- The starting point: first mood log, first session, baseline PHQ-9
- Key moments marked as **waypoints**: first milestone, crisis survived, breakthrough session
- The path forward: treatment plan goals as upcoming destinations
- Animated journey: a small figure (or the familiar) moves along the path as the patient progresses
- Mood encoded in the landscape: dark periods are foggy/stormy sections; bright periods are sunlit clearings
- The path is always continuing forward — even after setbacks, the path keeps going

**Design**: Canvas-rendered, scrollable horizontally, deeply personal

---

## GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR EVERYTHING WE BUILD

1. **Clinical first** — every feature defensible to a clinician reviewer
2. **Privacy by design** — assume the most sensitive data, protect accordingly
3. **Trauma-informed** — no jarring alerts, no clinical jargon without explanation, no time pressure
4. **Evidence-based** — tied to NICE guidelines and published literature
5. **Accessible** — WCAG 2.1 AA minimum, designed for cognitive load
6. **AI assists, humans decide** — AI never acts without clinician review on clinical matters
7. **Transparent** — patients know how their data is used; clinicians know how AI works
8. **The Healing Journey** — every interaction should honour that this person is doing something brave and hard. Make it feel that way.
9. **World class** — the question is always: "Would this be at home in the best mental health platform in the world?"

## ON GITHUB → UPDATES TAB INTEGRATION

Achievable in ~1 hour:
1. GitHub Actions workflow on push to `main`
2. Action calls `POST /api/dev/updates` with commit message, author, auto-incremented version
3. Update appears in all users' "What's New" tab automatically
4. Filter: only commits prefixed `feat:`, `fix:`, `improve:` trigger updates
5. API endpoint already exists — only the GitHub Action needs adding
