To make this script executable on Ubuntu, you need to save the code into a .py file and ensure your system has the necessary Python libraries installed. Ubuntu usually comes with Python, but customtkinter and requests need to be added manually.
1. Install Dependencies

Open your terminal and run the following command to install the required libraries:
Bash

pip install customtkinter requests

Note: If pip is not installed, run sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-pip first.
2. Create the Script File

You can create the file directly from the terminal using the nano editor:

    Type nano healing_space.py in your terminal.

    Paste the entire code block provided in the previous response into the editor.

    Press Ctrl + O then Enter to save.

    Press Ctrl + X to exit.

3. Make it Executable

To run the script like a standalone program, you need to change its permissions:
Bash

chmod +x healing_space.py

chmod +x healing_space.py
chmod +x healing_space.py
x
X
