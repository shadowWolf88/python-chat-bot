### Your Role

> "We provide: Fully built system, clinical safety documentation, data security, maintenance for 12 months minimum. No cost to the university. We profit when this goes NHS; you benefit from research opportunity."

## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION (What Could Go Wrong)

| Risk | How It Could Happen | Prevention |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Ethics approval delayed** | Committee wants more info, slow review | Submit comprehensive docs (already done), be responsive to questions |
| **Clinical advisor unavailable** | No qualified psychiatrist/psychologist at Lincoln | Identify 2-3 potential advisors early, backup plan for external consultant |
| **10-min response time unrealistic** | Clinicians can't respond that fast in practice | Be flexible in protocol adjustment, work with advisor to set realistic times |
| **Lincoln loses interest** | They say "too risky" or "too time-consuming" | Show them burden is minimal (2 hrs/month) + benefits (research opportunity, reputation) |
| **Patient recruitment slow** | Students/staff reluctant to participate | Start with staff/faculty (easier), build to patients after ethics approval |
| **System fails during testing** | Code bugs, database issues, alerts don't fire | Comprehensive testing (already planned), failsafe mechanisms documented |

Subject: Digital Mental Health Research Tool - Partnership Opportunity

Dear [Head of Psychology Name],

I am developing Healing Space, a digital mental health companion tool using 
validated assessment protocols (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale - C-SSRS). 
I am approaching the Psychology Department at Lincoln University as my research 
partner for clinical validation and user testing during our university trial phase.

The tool incorporates:
✓ Validated C-SSRS suicide risk assessment (peer-reviewed, 20+ years in clinical use)
✓ Clinician alert system for high-risk patients (tested, reliable)
✓ GDPR-compliant data handling (encrypted, audited, secure)
✓ Comprehensive safety protocols (crisis response, incident management)

I am seeking a 12-month research partnership where:
- Your role: Provide clinical oversight, ethics approval, user testing feedback
- My role: Build system, maintain it, handle all technical work
- Outcome: Validated tool ready for NHS deployment + publication opportunity

Before formal engagement, I have prepared comprehensive governance documentation:
1. Clinical Safety Case (demonstrates risk management)
2. Crisis Response Protocol (shows how system handles emergencies)
3. Patient Information Leaflet (for informed consent)
4. Data Protection Impact Assessment (GDPR compliance)

These documents are ready for your ethics committee review. No cost to the 
university; we handle all development and hosting.

Would you be available for a 20-30 minute call on [suggest 2-3 dates] to discuss 
this opportunity?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Title/Phone]
[Your Email]

Attachments: [4 governance documents as PDFs]

## 📞 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: "Will they even be interested?"**  
A: Very likely. Universities love research opportunities with minimal resource commitment. You're offering: validated tool, research publication, innovation credential. Perfect fit.

**Q: "What if they say no?"**  
A: Have backup list: University of Manchester, Sheffield, UCL mental health departments. Start with 3 universities in parallel (you have good documents).

**Q: "How long until we have real users?"**  
A: 10 weeks if ethics approved quickly. Most likely 12-14 weeks (ethics can be slow). But worth it—university backing is valuable for NHS.

**Q: "What if C-SSRS algorithm is wrong?"**  
A: You'll catch this during university trial (staff testing). That's the whole point—validate before NHS. Have clinical advisor review algorithm against published standard.

**Q: "Do we need a lawyer yet?"**  
A: Not yet. University ethics committee will flag legal issues. Get lawyer involved when you approach NHS (future).
