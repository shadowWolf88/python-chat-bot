# HEALING SPACE: PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLET

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 7, 2026  
**Plain Language Summary**

---

## WHAT IS HEALING SPACE?

Healing Space is a digital tool that helps your therapist or counselor understand how you're feeling. It uses a simple questionnaire called the **C-SSRS** (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale) that has been used in hospitals and research centers for over 20 years.

**It is NOT a replacement for talking to your clinician. It is a SUPPORT TOOL to help them provide better care.**

---

## WHAT WILL HAPPEN?

### Step 1: You Complete a Questionnaire (5-10 minutes)
- You'll answer 6 simple questions about how you're feeling
- Questions are about your mood, thoughts, and how you're coping
- There are **no right or wrong answers** – just be honest
- You can take your time; there's no rush

### Step 2: Your Clinician Reviews Your Answers
- Your therapist or counselor will see your responses
- They'll review it within **24 hours** (or sooner if urgent)
- They may talk to you about your answers in your next session
- This helps them understand you better and provide better support

### Step 3: If You're at Risk
- If your answers show you might be thinking about suicide, the system will **alert your clinician immediately**
- Your clinician will contact you to make sure you're safe
- You'll be asked to complete a **safety plan** (things that help when you're struggling)
